# Machine Learning on Iris Dataset

This project involves the application of various machine learning classification methods on the Iris dataset and comparing their performance. The Iris dataset contains measurements of various iris flowers' characteristics (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and their species.

## About the Dataset

The Iris dataset consists of 150 observations of three different iris flower species (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, Iris virginica). The dataset comprises five features:

- SepalLengthCm: Sepal length
- SepalWidthCm: Sepal width
- PetalLengthCm: Petal length
- PetalWidthCm: Petal width
- Species: Iris flower species

## Description of the Code

In this project, machine learning classification methods are applied to the Iris dataset using the Python programming language and various libraries. The following machine learning classification methods are implemented:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes
- Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
- AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting)
- Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)

The performance of each model is evaluated using the accuracy score. Performance differences between training and test datasets are also observed.

## Installation and Usage

To use the project, Python must be installed. You can install the necessary libraries using the following command:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost

The code requires a file named `Iris.csv` to be present. Then, you can run the code in a Python environment:

python Iris.ipyb

This README file is prepared to explain the purpose of the project, the dataset used, the machine learning methods applied, and how to use the code.
